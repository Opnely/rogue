## Auto-Pause Patch for Rogue 5.4.4
When an unseen monster appears next to the hero, the game pauses and prints a notification message. The player has to press space to continue.

The patch is useful for two reasons:

1. It speeds the gameplay up.  
2. It preserves the eyesight because the player no longer has to intensely focus on the adjacent squares when moving the hero.

### Important Note
The patch is based on the modified version https://github.com/gillesdami/rogue by Damien GILLES. Damien added compatibility with libncurses5 to the original version https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue , which allows rogue to compile on modern machines.
